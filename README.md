## Current Status (07/11/2025)

### âœ… Recently Fixed Issues

#### 1. Race Conditions in Storage
- **Problem**: `chrome.storage.local.get/set` had race conditions causing log loss
- **Solution**: In-memory array with reliable append operations

#### 2. Message Flow Issues
- **Problem**: Content script wasn't properly forwarding all log levels
- **Solution**: Fixed message listener to handle all levels correctly

#### 3. Timing Issues
- **Problem**: Console overrides happening before recording started
- **Solution**: Better initialization timing and polling mechanism
