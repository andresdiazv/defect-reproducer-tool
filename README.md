# Tab Recorder - Defect Reproduction Tool

A Chrome extension for recording tab actions to help with defect reproduction, starting with comprehensive console logging and network request monitoring.

## Features

- **Console Log Recording**: Captures all console methods (`log`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`)
- **Network Request Recording**: Captures fetch and XMLHttpRequest calls with full request/response data
- **Real-time Recording**: Start/stop recording with a single click
- **Export Functionality**: Export captured logs as JSON with timestamps and metadata
- **Cross-tab Support**: Works on any webpage
- **Reliable Performance**: No race conditions or timing issues

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension icon will appear in your toolbar

## Usage

1. **Start Recording**: Click the extension icon and press "Start Recording"
2. **Interact with the page**: Navigate, click buttons, trigger console logs and network requests
3. **Stop Recording**: Click "Stop Recording" when done
4. **Export Data**: Click "Export Data" to download a JSON file with all captured logs and network requests

## Current Status (07/11/2025)

### âœ… Recently Fixed Issues

#### 1. Race Conditions in Storage
- **Problem**: `chrome.storage.local.get/set` had race conditions causing log loss
- **Solution**: In-memory array with reliable append operations

#### 2. Message Flow Issues
- **Problem**: Content script wasn't properly forwarding all log levels
- **Solution**: Fixed message listener to handle all levels correctly

#### 3. Timing Issues
- **Problem**: Console overrides happening before recording started
- **Solution**: Better initialization timing and polling mechanism

### ðŸš€ Current Capabilities

âœ… `console.log()` messages  
âœ… `console.error()` messages  
âœ… `console.warn()` messages  
âœ… `console.info()` messages  
âœ… `console.debug()` messages  
âœ… `fetch()` requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  
âœ… `XMLHttpRequest` calls  
âœ… Network request headers and response bodies  
âœ… Proper timestamps and metadata  
âœ… Works on first click (no more double-click needed)

## Technical Details
